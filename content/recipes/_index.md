### Rationnal (If any is possible...)
For a while now i have found it to be more and more difficult to simply look for a cooking recipe online.GPDR made things even more challenging... Recipes blogs have a lot of unwanted J.S, unwanted back-storry around the recipe and loading pages is now slower than 10 years ago...

I got inspired by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) project called [Based Cooking](https://based.cooking/) and it's not impossible that some recipes will find their way to based.cooking

This section has no other way than storing recipes for me instead of storing them on a notebook or on some third-app application.
