## How ?
- Add all water with yeast, honey and 2/3 of the flour. The result should be a loose paste almost liquid. We are basically creating a levain here.
- Wait 1 hour for the levain to ferment and bubble
- Add the remaining ingredients and mix. The dough should not feel too tacky but a bit of tacky is fine.
- Wait 1 hour for the dough to rise.
- Divide the dough in balls according to you cooking plan and let the dough balls ferment in the fridge for 6 to 8 hours.
- Enjoy and don't forget to crank the oven as hot as you can.
