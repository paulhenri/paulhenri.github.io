## Links i like
Currently placing here links of things i like / find usefull in diverse fields. I find it easier for me to just show friends the website and then they can grab whatever link they need. Also acting as a vault for me to store some links. The list here is the result of a perpetual "work" to trim it some days and to fill it other days.
