Hi, i'm Paul-Henri ! I try to be a software developper on a daily basis and when comes the weekend i enjoy riding, brewing beers and messing with wrenches and ratchets. 
For a living i act as the main developer of the ERP software SIRIUS, aimed at chemicals, aromatics and perfumes industries. On my free time i like to learn new things and try new projects on subjects i do not really encounter in my daily work.

## Things i know and i like to use 
* Rust 
* Elixir / Phoenix
* SQL (90% of it by SQL Server)
* Javascript 
* HTML / CSS 
* Linux / Manjaro (I'll admit, i blew up an Arch install and tried Manjaro, sticked with it because it works :) )
* Windev Wlangage (For work)
* I also try to help translating lessons from ![https://elixirschool.com/](Elixir School) in French
